# DRC

This soft is intended to measure a loudspeaker's in-room response, then calculate a FIR filter to perform DRC equalization (digital room correction). You'll ned to use a convolver inserted in the loudspeakers signal path, such **Brutefir** as used [here](https://github.com/AudioHumLab/pe.audio.sys)

The applied test signal will be a **log sweep** chirp.

## Testing your sound card settings

The main meas script is **`logsweep2TF.py`**. It is based on a public licensed Matlab program from Richard Mann and John Vanderkooy, published at [linearaudio.net](https://linearaudio.net/downloads) (Vol.13).

This software not only performs the freq response calculation of your sound system, it also provides a **_time clearance_** checking of the meassurement chain, depending on the total latency and the selected log-sweep lenght.

Graphical information will help you also to detect inaudible gaps that can appear from your hardware stuff. The following both channels direct loop ilustrates this anomalie:

## Multipoint measurement


The script **`roommeasure.py`** allows to perform **_stationary measurements in several mic locations_**, then resulting an averaged frequency response in `.frd` file format.

The spatial amplitude for mic locations relies in the user criteria, depending on the listening scenario.


### JACK management

When measuring a [JACK based loudspeaker system](https://github.com/AudioHumLab), **`roommeasure.py`** can help on routing the loudspeaker system stereo soundcard analog input towards the convenient loudspeaker channel. So you won't need to rewire your cable from L to R and so on ;-)

## DRC EQ filter calculation

The script **`roomEQ.py`** is in charge to calculate the FIR filter for DRC EQ, from a given `.frd` freq response file, as the one provided from **`roommeasure.py`**, or other software e.g : ARTA or Room EQ Wizard.

**`roomEQ.py`** allows to generate a FIR with selectable resolution (length) and sampling frequency.

The **reference level** on which it is applied the EQ is automatically detected, but you can manually choose it after visualizing the proposed curves.


```
    roomEQ.py

    Calculates room equalizer FIRs from a given in-room freq. responses,
    usually an averaged ones as the provided from 'roommeasure.py'.

    Usage:

        roomEQ.py response.frd [response2.frd ...]   [ options ]

            -fs=        Output FIR sampling freq (default 48000 Hz)

            -e=         Exponent 2^XX for FIR length in taps.
                        (default 15, i.e. 2^15=32 Ktaps)

            -ref=       Reference level in dB (default autodetected)

            -schro=     Schroeder freq. (default 200 Hz)

            -doFIR      Generates the pcm FIR after estimating the final EQ.

                ~~~ Gaussian windows to progressively limit positive EQ: ~~~

            -wLfc=      Low window center freq (default: midband centered at 1000 Hz)

            -wHfc=      High window center freq (default: same as wLfc)

            -wLoct=     Span in octaves for the left side of wL  (def: 5 oct)

            -wHoct=     Span in octaves for the right side of wH (def: 5 oct)

            -noPos      Does not allow positive gains at all



    ABOUT POSITIVE EQ GAIN:

    If desired, then a gaussian window will be used to limit positive gains.

    Two windows are available: wL works on the lower freq band, wH on highs.

    These windows by default are centered at midband 1000 Hz with symmetric
    span shapes of 5 oct, so minimized at 20 Hz and 20 Khz ends.

    If the measured level extends over most of the range 20 Hz ~ 20 KHz
    (the 10 octaves audio band), the default shape usually works fine.

    If the measured response has significant limitations on the upper band,
    you may want to extend the right side of wH by setting wHoct > 5.

    Usually the default 5 oct left side window span (low freq) works fine.


    ABOUT SCHROEDER FREQ.:

    The Schroeder frequency determines the range beyond which the modal room
    behavior is no longer considered, so the target EQ curve will be progressively
    smoothed out to rule out fine EQ beyond the Schroeder frequency.


```

## FIR application

The obtained FIR filter is given in two formats: 

- a raw PCM impulse 32 bit float file per channel
- a stereo WAV 32 bit float file

The impulses must be loaded into a convolver as **Brutefir** in Linux, or into a generic reverb plugin as Wave's IR1 in a DAW, or into a hardware convolver as miniDSP.

Here we propose the evolutions [pe.audio.sys](https://github.com/AudioHumLab) or [pre.di.c](https://github.com/AudioHumLab) from the original project [FIRtro](https://github.com/AudioHumLab/FIRtro/wiki/01---Introducci√≥n) (currently not maintained), which are based on the excellent **Brutefir** convolver.

    sh update-DRC.sh master


## Using DRC

You can use a **Linux** or **Mac OS** laptop, equipped with a suitable sound card and measurement mic.

Note that you need to install Python3 and some of its standard modules, see:

- [macOS.md](https://github.com/Rsantct/DRC/blob/master/doc/macOS.md)

- [Linux.md](https://github.com/Rsantct/DRC/blob/master/doc/Linux.md)


To run this software, just launch the DRC Graphic User Interface from a terminal:

    ~/DRC/DRC_GUI.py &

For macOS users you can prepare a desktop icon, see details in file [macOS.md](https://github.com/Rsantct/DRC/blob/master/doc/macOS.md)
