## The measurement MIC

You need some sound card + measurement MIC in order to take in room measurements.

I recently tested a 2021 Macbook Pro built-in microphone, and the recording is actually passable compared to an ECM800 for unsophisticated room measurements.

You only need to face the Mac keyboard plane towards the speaker.

So I updated xxxxxx to accept a mono input sound device, like the MBP built-in microphone.
